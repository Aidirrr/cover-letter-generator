A Streamlit web application that leverages **Google's Gemini AI** to generate professional, tailored cover letters. Users can input their personal information, job details, and upload their resume (PDF). The app extracts text from the resume, incorporates additional user-provided details (e.g., internship duration), and generates a polished cover letter. The output can be downloaded as a **PDF** or **DOCX** file.
